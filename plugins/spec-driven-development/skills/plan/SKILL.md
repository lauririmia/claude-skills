name: plan
description: Transforms a SPEC.md, PRD.md, or ISSUE-N.md into a concrete TDD implementation plan saved as docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md (or PLAN-N.md for issues). Enters plan-mode, invokes writing-plans, stops before execution. When invoked with a PRD.md or ISSUE-N.md (complex workflow after /prd), first confirms slug and sets up a branch or worktree before planning. Use when user says "plan me", "plan this", "make a plan from", or wants to turn a spec, PRD, or issue into a step-by-step implementation plan.

# Plan-Me — Spec, PRD, or Issue to Implementation Plan

Reads a SPEC.md, PRD.md, or ISSUE-N.md file and produces a TDD implementation plan saved locally. Stops before execution.

## Model & Thinking

Use **Claude Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet`) with **high thinking effort** (`ultrathink`) for all reasoning in this skill.

## Language

Conduct all dialogue with the user — questions, checkpoints, granularity choices, status updates — exclusively in Romanian, regardless of the language the input file was written in.

All deliverables this skill writes (`docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md` or `PLAN-N.md`, commit messages) must always be written in English, independent of the Romanian dialogue above. This applies to the `writing-plans` invocation too: hold the interview in Romanian, but write the plan document itself in English.

## Invocation

Pass the input file path explicitly:

> `/plan-me docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md`
> `/plan-me docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PRD.md`
> `/plan-me docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-ISSUE-N.md`

If no path is provided, stop and ask: *"Please specify the input file path, e.g. `docs/01-auth-forms-SPEC.md`, `docs/01-auth-forms-PRD.md`, or `docs/01-auth-forms-ISSUE-1.md`."*

## Feature ID Prefix

Every file this skill writes under `docs/` (`PLAN.md` or `PLAN-N.md`) is named `<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-TYPE.md`, reusing the SAME `<feature-id>` carried by the input file's own filename — this plan belongs to the same feature as the SPEC/PRD/ISSUE it was generated from, not a new one. See Step 1 below.

## Output and Context Rules

These rules govern everything this skill prints to the main conversation — the `writing-plans` invocation and the generated plan document itself are unaffected.

- **Never paste full file contents into the chat.** Do not quote the SPEC/PRD/ISSUE input, the predecessor log, or the generated plan verbatim in the conversation — refer to them by path. OVERRIDE 5 already keeps the plan itself out of the console; extend the same discipline to every file this skill reads.
- **Checkpoints and choices stay short.** Present the fixed option lists (branch strategy, granularity) exactly as specified, with no extra restating of file contents or prior context around them.
- **Status updates are one line each** ("Step 1: input read, slug=`auth-forms`", "Step 5: plan committed") — no recap of steps already completed.
- **If the predecessor log or `git diff` reveals a discrepancy, summarize it in 1-3 lines** in the generated plan (as already specified in Step 1), not as a full quoted diff in the chat.
- **Default to the minimal useful output.** If unsure how much detail to show in dialogue, show less and offer to expand on request.

## Process

### Step 1 — Read the input file

Read the file at the provided path. If it does not exist, stop and tell the user.

Determine the **input type** and extract `<feature-id>`, `<idea-slug>`, and the output path — the output reuses the SAME `<feature-id>` as the input, since the plan belongs to the same feature:
- `docs/01-auth-forms-SPEC.md` → type = SPEC, feature-id = `01`, slug = `auth-forms`, output = `docs/01-auth-forms-PLAN.md`
- `docs/01-auth-forms-PRD.md` → type = PRD, feature-id = `01`, slug = `auth-forms`, output = `docs/01-auth-forms-PLAN.md`
- `docs/01-auth-forms-ISSUE-1.md` → type = ISSUE, feature-id = `01`, slug = `auth-forms`, issue = `1`, output = `docs/01-auth-forms-PLAN-1.md`

#### Predecessor log check (ISSUE inputs only)

If the input type is ISSUE and `N > 1`:
1. Check whether `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-ISSUE-(N-1)-LOG.md` exists — same `<feature-id>` as this run's input, since every file for this feature shares it.
2. If it does not exist (the prior issue not yet implemented or not yet logged), no-op — current behavior unchanged.
3. If it exists, read only that one file (not a glob of all prior issues) and hold it as **supplemental** context for Step 4 — it never overrides the current issue's spec, the PRD, or what the actual code shows.
   - If the log's `## Verification` reads "Not yet verified," treat its claims as lower-confidence and say so in the generated plan.
   - If the log's content contradicts the codebase, follow the codebase and add a short "Prior log discrepancy" note in the generated plan describing what differed.

### Step 2 — Branch setup (PRD and ISSUE inputs only)

**Skip this step entirely if the input is a SPEC.md** — the branch or worktree was already established by `/spec`.

When invoked with a PRD.md or ISSUE-N.md, the session is on the main branch because `/prd` merges back before handing off. Before planning, establish the workspace.

#### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1 — Slug confirmation (MANDATORY, do not skip)

The slug was extracted from the filename. Propose it to the user and **wait for explicit confirmation before continuing**. The user may correct it if the filename doesn't reflect the right slug. Do NOT proceed until the user approves or corrects it.

#### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2 — Branch strategy (MANDATORY, do not skip)

Present exactly these three options and ask the user to choose one — do not reduce to two:
- **1. main** — plan directly on the current branch
- **2. branch** — create and switch to `feature/<idea-slug>` (or `feature/<idea-slug>-<N>` for an ISSUE input)
- **3. worktree** — create a git worktree at `../<idea-slug>` on branch `feature/<idea-slug>` (isolated workspace, recommended for larger plans)

After the user picks, invoke `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` if option 3 was chosen. Set up the chosen environment before proceeding.

### Step 3 — Enter plan-mode

Call `EnterPlanMode` immediately. All work happens in plan-mode to prevent accidental execution.

### Step 4 — Run writing-plans

#### Granularity choice (before invoking writing-plans)

Default to **"Balanced — one step per logical unit of work"** and proceed silently — do not ask the user, since Balanced is already the documented default and re-asking on every run adds friction without adding signal in the common case.

Only surface the three-option question when the input content clearly signals, in qualitative terms (no numeric thresholds), unusually large/complex or unusually trivial scope. Example signals:
- The scope spans multiple independent subsystems or user-facing flows.
- The description itself calls out unusual risk, migration, or rollback complexity.
- The change is a single-line/trivial fix with no meaningful design decisions.

These examples guide judgment — they don't replace it with a threshold. When one of these (or a comparable) signal is present, present exactly these three options in chat and wait for the user's choice:
- **1. Fewer, larger steps** — faster execution, less intermediate validation
- **2. Balanced** (default — recommend this unless the input suggests otherwise) — one step per logical unit of work
- **3. More, smaller steps** — maximum checkpoints, more context-switch overhead

Wording must differ by input type: when the input is `ISSUE-N.md` (already a single vertical slice from `prd`), the three options size **implementation tasks within that slice**, not features — replace "steps" wording with "implementation tasks" in the ISSUE-N.md case to avoid re-litigating PRD-level decomposition.

Hold the resulting choice — whether auto-selected Balanced or the user's literal answer to the three-option question (e.g. `"Balanced — one step per logical unit of work"`) — it is interpolated into OVERRIDE 7 below when invoking `writing-plans`.

Use the `Skill` tool to invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` with these overrides:

> **OVERRIDE 1 — input:** The feature description comes from the file read in Step 1, not from conversation context. If a predecessor log was found per the Predecessor log check above, include it as supplemental context (with any lower-confidence or discrepancy notes) alongside the primary input.
>
> **OVERRIDE 2 — output:** Save the final plan to `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md` (or `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN-N.md` for an issue input). Do NOT use the default plan file location.
>
> **OVERRIDE 3 — tests:** For each implementation step, include the specific tests or verification commands that confirm that step is complete. Write tests before implementation code (TDD order).
>
> **OVERRIDE 4 — terminal state:** Stop after the plan is written and approved. Do NOT proceed to `executing-plans` or any implementation step.
>
> **OVERRIDE 6 — agentic worker instruction:** In the generated plan document, replace any "For agentic workers" line with exactly:
> `**For agentic workers:** Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development to implement this plan task-by-task. Each task must follow superpowers:test-driven-development.`
> Do NOT mention superpowers:executing-plans anywhere in the plan.
>
> **OVERRIDE 5 — plan writing & review:** When the plan is ready to be written:
> 1. Write it directly to `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md` (or `PLAN-N.md`) without displaying its full content in the console. Just confirm the path.
> 2. Tell the user: *"Plan written to `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md`. Please review it and let me know if you have any changes or if you approve."*
> 3. If the user provides feedback, update the file accordingly and ask again.
> 4. When the user explicitly approves (e.g. "looks good", "approve", "done", "ok"), return control — do NOT commit here.

> **OVERRIDE 7 — granularity:** A granularity was determined above this invocation (auto-selected Balanced, or the user's explicit choice). Include that choice **verbatim** here (e.g. "OVERRIDE 7 — granularity: the user chose 'Balanced — one step per logical unit of work'; size all plan steps accordingly"), since writing-plans is an invoked skill, not a typed API — the constraint only takes effect if it is literally present in this prompt.

Follow every other writing-plans step as written.

### Step 5 — Commit

After `writing-plans` returns (user has approved the plan):

1. `git add docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md` (or `PLAN-N.md`)
2. `git commit -m "docs: add implementation plan for <idea-slug>"`

Do NOT push. Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT wait for additional user input — approval in Step 4 is sufficient.

### Step 6 — Confirm stop

After committing, say:

> *"Plan saved to `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md`. To implement, run `/implement` with the plan file path."*

⛔ **HARD STOP — do not continue past this point.** ExitPlanMode approval is approval of the plan document only — it is NOT authorization to implement. The plan file is the only deliverable of this skill. Return control to the user immediately after Step 6.

## Output

- `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN.md` — TDD implementation plan derived from a SPEC.md or PRD.md
- `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-PLAN-N.md` — TDD implementation plan for a single vertical slice, derived from an ISSUE-N.md

## Common Rationalizations

| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll figure it out as I go" | That's how you get a tangled mess and rework. 10 minutes of planning saves hours. |
| "The tasks are obvious, no need to write them" | Writing tasks surfaces hidden dependencies and forgotten edge cases. |
| "Planning is overhead" | Planning is the task. Implementation without a plan is just typing. |
| "I can hold it all in my head" | Context windows are finite. Written plans survive session boundaries and compaction. |

## Hard Rules

- Do NOT invoke `executing-plans` or any implementation skill.
- Do NOT write code.
- Do NOT start executing — that is the user's decision in a new session.
- Always read the input file before invoking writing-plans.
- Always run Step 2 (branch setup) for PRD and ISSUE inputs — do NOT skip it even if you think the branch already exists.
- Always commit after user approves — do NOT skip Step 5. Do NOT push.
