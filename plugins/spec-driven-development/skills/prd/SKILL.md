description: Transforms a SPEC.md spec into a PRD document and one markdown file per issue — all saved locally, no GitHub required. The user must pass the SPEC.md path explicitly. Use when user says "prd-me", "create prd from spec", or wants to convert a spec file into a PRD and issues without pushing to GitHub.

# PRD-Me — Spec to PRD + Issues

Reads a SPEC.md file and produces a structured PRD and one markdown file per issue.

## Model & Thinking

Use **Claude Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet`) with **medium thinking effort** for all reasoning in this skill.

## Language

Conduct all dialogue with the user — questions, seam confirmations, granularity choices, status updates — exclusively in Romanian, regardless of the language `SPEC.md` was written in.

`docs/<idea-slug>-PRD.md` and `docs/<idea-slug>-ISSUE-N.md` start in Romanian too: `02-write-prd.md` and `04-write-issues.md` write the initial drafts in Romanian so the user reviews and approves them in the same language as the rest of the conversation. The moment the user gives explicit approval on each, translate that file (or set of files) in place into English — see those steps for the translation instructions. `03-issue-breakdown.md` therefore always receives an English-language `PRD.md`, and the commit in `04-write-issues.md` always commits English-language files. From that point on, everything downstream — the committed docs, commit messages, and the handoff to `plan` — is in English, because `plan` and the rest of the plugin's tooling work in English.

## Invocation

The user must pass the SPEC.md file path explicitly:

> `/prd-me docs/<idea-slug>-SPEC.md`

If no path is provided, stop and ask: *"Please specify the SPEC.md file path, e.g. `docs/auth-forms-SPEC.md`."*

## Output and Context Rules

These rules govern everything this skill prints to the main conversation, across all steps in `steps/`.

- **Never paste full file contents into the chat.** SPEC.md, PRD.md, and ISSUE-N.md are written directly to disk and referenced by path (already the rule in `02-write-prd.md` and `04-write-issues.md`) — extend the same discipline to codebase exploration in `00-read-and-explore.md`: summarize what you found, don't quote whole files.
- **Explore the codebase with targeted reads, not exhaustive ones.** Grep/search for the relevant seams first; read only the files or sections that inform the PRD, not entire directories.
- **Issue and breakdown lists stay compact.** The numbered breakdown in `03-issue-breakdown.md` shows title/type/blocked-by only — no restating of PRD content per issue.
- **Status updates are one line each** ("PRD written to `docs/<idea-slug>-PRD.md`", "3 issue files written") — no recap of prior steps.
- **Default to the minimal useful output.** If unsure how much detail to show in dialogue, show less and offer to expand on request.

## Process

Read and follow each file in `steps/` **one at a time, in numeric order, immediately before executing it** — not all six upfront. Each step file is mandatory context for its own step, not optional background — do not skip a step file or rely on the index summary alone as a substitute for reading it.

1. `steps/00-read-and-explore.md` — read SPEC.md, explore codebase
2. `steps/01-seams.md` — identify and confirm testing seams
3. `steps/02-write-prd.md` — write PRD.md (Scope Boundary: What, Not How)
4. `steps/03-issue-breakdown.md` — upfront granularity choice, draft issue breakdown
5. `steps/04-write-issues.md` — write issue files, commit
6. `steps/05-handoff.md` — confirm

## Output

- `docs/<idea-slug>-PRD.md` — structured PRD
- `docs/<idea-slug>-ISSUE-1.md` … `docs/<idea-slug>-ISSUE-N.md` — one file per vertical slice

## Hard Rules

- Do NOT proceed without reading the SPEC.md file first.
- Do NOT push anything to GitHub.
- Do NOT write code.
- Do NOT invoke `writing-plans` or any implementation skill.
- `PRD.md` and `ISSUE-N.md` are written in Romanian first — never hand off to `03-issue-breakdown.md` with a Romanian `PRD.md` still on disk, and never commit in `04-write-issues.md` with any `ISSUE-N.md` still in Romanian.
