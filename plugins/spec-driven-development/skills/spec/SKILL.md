description: Two-act spec hardening. ACT 1 (you ↔ Claude) — collaborative brainstorming produces an approved spec (2-3 approaches, visual companion, one question at a time). ACT 2 (Claude ↔ Codex) — OpenAI Codex adversarially reviews the spec (content passed inline — no filesystem sandbox) until APPROVED or MAX_ROUNDS cap. Use when user says "spec me codex", "spec and stress-test", or is defining a high-stakes feature (auth, schema, payments, concurrency) and wants collaborative exploration AND a cross-model sanity check before implementation planning.

# Spec-Me-Codex — Collaborative Spec + Adversarial Review

Two acts, two jobs:
- **Act 1** fixes the #1 failure mode: speccing the wrong thing.
- **Act 2** fixes the #2 failure mode: a spec that sounds right but breaks.

## Model & Thinking

Use **Claude Sonnet** (`claude-sonnet`) with **high thinking effort** (`ultrathink`) for all reasoning in this skill.

## Language

Conduct all dialogue with the user — questions, proposed approaches, confirmations, status updates — exclusively in Romanian, regardless of the language the project/feature description was written in.

`docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SESSION.md` is a scratch file that never leaves Act 1 and is deleted before Resolution (see Persistence and Resolution below) — write it in Romanian, matching the dialogue it mirrors.

`docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md` and `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC-REVIEW.md` start in Romanian too: Step 5 writes the initial spec in Romanian so the user reviews and approves it in the same language as the rest of the conversation. The moment the user gives explicit approval (Step 5, before Act 2 begins), translate both files in place into English — see Step 5b. From that point on, everything related to these two files (further edits, the Codex review exchange, the append-only log, commit messages) stays in English, because Act 2 hands `SPEC.md`'s content inline to Codex and the rest of the skill's tooling assumes English. Internal reasoning stays in English throughout.

## Feature ID Prefix

Every file this skill writes under `docs/` is named `<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-TYPE.md`. `<feature-id>` identifies the feature (this slug) — the same id any upstream DESIGN.md/IDEATE.md for this slug already carries, or a freshly assigned one if this slug has never been seen before (computed at CHECKPOINT 2 below). It is never part of the slug itself: the slug alone names branches, tags, and `feature/<idea-slug>` (see Checkpoint 3 and `sdd:finalize`).

## Persistence

Maintain `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SESSION.md` throughout the session. Creation is handled by ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2 — this section describes upkeep only. This is a scratch file that only exists to survive a context compaction mid-session — it is deleted, never committed, once the deliverables are finalized (see Resolution below).

**During the session:** update `Decisions Reached` and `Open Questions` after each major brainstorming checkpoint (approach chosen, design section approved, etc.).

**When Act 1 concludes:** append `## Final Spec Path: docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md` to the session file.

## Output and Context Rules

These rules govern everything this skill prints to the main conversation. They do not apply to `SESSION.md`, `SPEC.md`, or `SPEC-REVIEW.md` on disk, which are the full-detail record of the session.

- **Never paste full file contents into the chat.** `SPEC.md` is written directly to disk (already the rule in Step 5) and referenced by path, not quoted — keep the same discipline for `SESSION.md` and the upstream `IDEATE.md`/`DESIGN.md` artifacts checked in Step 4.
- **Never dump Codex's raw JSON or full verdict text into the chat.** In Act 2, `SPEC-REVIEW.md` keeps the full transcript on disk (per "Each round" step 1); when relaying a round to the user, summarize in 3-5 bullets (the most material flaws) plus the verdict line — do not read or paste the entire contents of `/tmp/codex-verdict.txt` into the conversation.
- **Assumptions and success-criteria checkpoints (Step 4) stay short lists** — as templated, not padded with restated context.
- **At MAX_ROUNDS deadlock**, list unresolved points compactly (one line per point + one line for Claude's counter-position), not the full round-by-round history already stored in `SPEC-REVIEW.md`.
- **Status updates are one line each** ("Round 2: REVISE, 2 new findings addressed") — no recap of prior rounds.
- **Default to the minimal useful output.** If unsure how much detail to show, show less and point to the log file for the full record.

## ACT 1 — SPEC (you ↔ Claude)

### Step 1 — Git dirty-state check
Run `git status`. If there are any uncommitted, unstaged, or untracked files, tell the user to commit or stash changes before proceeding. Do NOT continue.

### Step 2 — Enter plan-mode
Call `EnterPlanMode` immediately.

### Step 3 — Identify idea-slug and branch strategy

#### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 1 — Slug approval (MANDATORY, do not skip)

1. From the user's description, derive `<idea-slug>` using these rules:
   - Lowercase, kebab-case
   - Only `a-z`, `0-9`, `-`
   - Replace spaces and punctuation with `-`
   - Collapse multiple `-` into one
   - Trim `-` from start and end
   - Maximum 40 characters

   Propose the slug to the user and **wait for explicit confirmation before continuing**. Do NOT proceed until the user approves or corrects it.

#### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 2 — Feature ID and session file (MANDATORY, do not skip)

Immediately after the slug is confirmed, determine `<feature-id>`:

1. List `docs/` for any file matching `[0-9][0-9]-<idea-slug>-*.md`.
2. If any match, this slug already has a feature id (from this same interrupted spec session, or from an earlier DESIGN/IDEATE stage for it) — use it as `<feature-id>`.
3. If none match, this slug has never been seen before: list `docs/` for **all** files matching `[0-9][0-9]-*.md` (any slug). `<feature-id>` is the highest two-digit prefix found across all of them, plus one — or `01` if `docs/` has no numbered files at all yet.

Reuse this same `<feature-id>` for every file this skill writes in this run.

Create `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SESSION.md`. Do this **now** — before the branch question, before brainstorming, before anything else. Do not defer or skip this because the session feels "short" or "simple": short sessions still get interrupted by context compaction.

```markdown
# Spec: <Idea Name>
Started: <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Summary
<one-paragraph description of what's being specced>

## Decisions Reached
<!-- updated at each brainstorming checkpoint -->

## Open Questions
<!-- updated as new questions surface -->
```

If `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SESSION.md` already exists (found by the scan above), read it and resume — skip decisions already settled.

#### ⛔ CHECKPOINT 3 — Branch strategy (MANDATORY, do not skip)

2. Present exactly these three options and ask the user to choose one — do not reduce to two:
   - **1. main** — commit directly to the current branch
   - **2. branch** — create and switch to `feature/<idea-slug>`
   - **3. worktree** — create a git worktree at `../<idea-slug>` on branch `feature/<idea-slug>` (isolated workspace, recommended for longer specs)
   
   After the user picks, invoke `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` if option 3 was chosen.
3. Set up the chosen environment before proceeding.

### Step 4 — Run brainstorming

**Before brainstorming**, check `docs/` for upstream artifacts from this slug (same `<feature-id>` determined at Checkpoint 2, since they belong to the same feature):
1. If `docs/<feature-id>-<slug>-IDEATE.md` exists: announce *"Found `docs/<feature-id>-<slug>-IDEATE.md` — using it as the starting point for brainstorming."* Start brainstorming from its content instead of the raw user description.
2. Else if `docs/<feature-id>-<slug>-DESIGN.md` exists: announce *"Found `docs/<feature-id>-<slug>-DESIGN.md` — using it as the starting point for brainstorming."* Start brainstorming from its content instead of the raw user description.
3. If neither exists: start brainstorming from the user's raw description (current behavior).

**Before invoking brainstorming**, surface all implicit assumptions the user has not stated:

```
ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:
1. [assumption about stack / tech]
2. [assumption about audience]
3. [assumption about constraints or scope]
→ Correct me now or I'll proceed with these.
```

Do not begin brainstorming until the user explicitly confirms or corrects the list.

**Success criteria override:** Whenever the user describes a vague objective (e.g. "make it faster", "improve UX"), reframe it as concrete, measurable success criteria before writing a spec section:

```
REQUIREMENT: "Make it faster"

REFRAMED SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- [specific measurable condition, e.g. "LCP < 2.5s on 4G"]
- [specific measurable condition]
→ Are these the right targets?
```

Do not write a spec section for an objective that cannot be directly verified.

Invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` with **two overrides**: do NOT invoke `writing-plans` at the end; and do NOT display the spec content in the console or commit automatically — see Step 5.

### Step 5 — Write SPEC.md
After the brainstorming is complete, write a structured summary directly to `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md`, **in Romanian**, without displaying its full content in the console:

```markdown
# Spec: <feature>
_Blocat prin brainstorming — de Claude + <user>_

## Obiectiv
<un paragraf care reflectă ce s-a stabilit prin brainstorming>

## Abordare
<abordarea aleasă și deciziile cheie de design>

## Decizii cheie și compromisuri
<alegeri discutabile — oferă-i lui Codex ceva de care să se agațe>

## Riscuri / întrebări deschise
<orice rămâne cu adevărat deschis>

## În afara scopului
<limite explicite stabilite în timpul brainstorming-ului>
```

Initialize `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC-REVIEW.md`, also in Romanian:
```
# Jurnal Review Spec: <feature>
Act 1 (brainstorming) finalizat — spec blocat cu userul. MAX_ROUNDS=<n>.
```

After writing both files:
1. Tell the user: *"Specul a fost scris în `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md`. Te rog să-l revizuiești și să-mi spui dacă ai modificări sau dacă îl aprobi."*
2. If the user provides feedback, update `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md` accordingly (still in Romanian) and ask again.
3. Only proceed once the user **explicitly approves** (e.g. "arată bine", "aprob", "gata", "ok"). Do NOT proceed automatically.
4. Once approved, run **Step 5b** before touching git or Act 2.

### Step 5b — Translate to English

The user just approved the Romanian spec — now bring it in line with the rest of the skill, which runs in English from here on (Act 2 hands `SPEC.md`'s content inline to Codex, and the log/commit conventions are English):

1. Translate `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md` in full into English, preserving the same structure (`# Spec: <feature>`, `_Locked via brainstorming — by Claude + <user>_`, `## Goal`, `## Approach`, `## Key decisions & tradeoffs`, `## Risks / open questions`, `## Out of scope`). Overwrite the file with the English version — do not keep the Romanian copy on disk.
2. Translate `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC-REVIEW.md`'s header into English (`# Spec Review Log: <feature>` / `Act 1 (brainstorming) complete — spec locked with user. MAX_ROUNDS=<n>.`) and overwrite it the same way.
3. Do not display the translated content in the console — same discipline as Step 5.
4. Only commit to git when the user **explicitly approves** (e.g. "looks good", "approve", "done", "ok"). Do NOT commit automatically. This is the same approval already captured at the end of Step 5 — the translation is a faithful rendering of what was just approved, not a content change, so it doesn't require asking again.
5. After the commit (or user approval without changes), proceed to Act 2 with the now-English `SPEC.md`.

## ACT 2 — REVIEW (Claude ↔ Codex)

### Prerequisites
- `codex --version` ≥ 0.130
- Codex authenticated (`codex login`; ChatGPT account is fine)
- Do NOT pin `-m` — ChatGPT-account auth rejects `gpt-5.x-codex` variants

### Tunables (read from args, else default)
| Var | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `MAX_ROUNDS` | `5` | Hard cap on review rounds |
| `SPEC_FILE` | `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md` | The spec Act 1 produced |
| `LOG_FILE` | `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC-REVIEW.md` | Append-only argument transcript |

### Review prompt strategy

Spec content is passed **inline** in the prompt — do NOT rely on Codex reading from the filesystem (bwrap sandbox blocks it). Claude reads `$SPEC_FILE` and embeds it directly.

### Round 1 — fresh session (capture thread_id)
```bash
SPEC_CONTENT=$(cat "$SPEC_FILE")
REVIEW_PROMPT="You are an adversarial reviewer for a feature spec. Be skeptical and specific — your job is to find what breaks, not to be agreeable. Here is the spec to review:

---
${SPEC_CONTENT}
---

Identify concrete flaws: missing requirements, ambiguous behavior, security implications, wrong assumptions, scope creep risks, simpler alternatives. For each flaw, give a one-line fix. Do NOT modify any files. End your reply with EXACTLY one line: \`VERDICT: APPROVED\` if the spec is sound enough to proceed to implementation planning, or \`VERDICT: REVISE\` if it still has material problems."

codex exec --json -o /tmp/codex-verdict.txt "$REVIEW_PROMPT" \
  2>/dev/null | grep '"type":"thread.started"'
```
Parse `thread_id` from `{"type":"thread.started","thread_id":"..."}`. Critique is in `/tmp/codex-verdict.txt`.

### Rounds 2..MAX — resume same session
```bash
SPEC_CONTENT=$(cat "$SPEC_FILE")
codex exec resume "$THREAD_ID" --json \
  -o /tmp/codex-verdict.txt \
  "I revised the spec. Here is the updated version:

---
${SPEC_CONTENT}
---

Re-review — check whether your prior findings are addressed and flag anything new. End with VERDICT: APPROVED or VERDICT: REVISE." \
  2>/dev/null >/dev/null
```

### Each round
1. Append Codex output to log:
```bash
echo "## Round <n> — Codex" >> "$LOG_FILE"
cat /tmp/codex-verdict.txt >> "$LOG_FILE"
```
2. Check last line of `/tmp/codex-verdict.txt` for verdict:
   - `VERDICT: APPROVED` → Resolution.
   - `VERDICT: REVISE` → Claude decides what's worth acting on (Claude is final arbiter). Revise `SPEC_FILE`. Then append Claude's response to log:
```bash
echo "### Claude's response" >> "$LOG_FILE"
echo "<what changed, what was rejected, why>" >> "$LOG_FILE"
```
   Increment round.
3. If round > `MAX_ROUNDS` → Resolution (deadlock).

### Resolution
- **APPROVED:** Output this summary and give a 3-bullet summary of what the two acts improved:
```
Title:     <feature title>
Slug:      <idea-slug>
Mode:      Branch | Worktree | Main
Spec file: docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md
Log file:  docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC-REVIEW.md
Rounds:    N
```
  `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SESSION.md` exists only to survive a context compaction mid-session — once SPEC.md and SPEC-REVIEW.md are finalized and about to be committed, its job is done. Delete it rather than committing it, so it never pollutes git history as a scratch file:
  ```bash
  rm -f docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SESSION.md
  ```

  Then propose a git commit — list the files to be staged and ask for confirmation:
  - `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md`
  - `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC-REVIEW.md`

  On user approval, commit with message `docs: finalize <idea-slug> spec (brainstorming + Codex review)`. Do NOT push.

  Then recommend a next step instead of asking a generic "ready to move on?" — assess whether the finished `docs/<feature-id>-<idea-slug>-SPEC.md` describes one cohesive unit of work or would benefit from being broken into independently shippable slices first:
  - **Recommend `/sdd:plan`** (the common case) when the spec describes a single vertical slice — even a multi-step feature — that one TDD plan can carry end-to-end and ship as one PR.
  - **Recommend `/sdd:prd`** instead when the spec itself describes 2+ independently shippable, user-visible behaviors — distinct user journeys, phases the spec already calls out separately, or subsystems that don't share a single code path. `/sdd:prd` breaks it into vertical-slice issues, each of which then gets its own `/sdd:plan` pass.

  State the recommendation as a default with a one-line reason, and let the user pick the other path if they disagree (per the Language section above, deliver this message in Romanian):

  > *"<brief reason, e.g. 'This spec describes a single flow — one implementation plan can cover it end-to-end.'> I recommend `/sdd:plan` as the next step. Do you want to continue with that, or would you rather go through `/sdd:prd` first to break it into separate issues?"*

  Do NOT invoke either skill automatically — wait for the user's choice.
- **MAX_ROUNDS deadlock:** List each unresolved point + Claude's counter-position. Hand to user to break the tie. After the user resolves, propose the same commit as above.

---

## Hard Rules
- Act 1 always precedes Act 2 — no SPEC.md until brainstorming has actually resolved with the user.
- `SPEC.md`/`SPEC-REVIEW.md` are Romanian until the user approves at the end of Step 5, then English from Step 5b onward — never enter Act 2 with a Romanian `SPEC.md` still on disk.
- Pass spec content **inline** every round — do NOT use `-s read-only` or `-c sandbox_mode="read-only"` (bwrap blocks filesystem reads, Codex will fail silently and hallucinate).
- Loop ALWAYS terminates at `MAX_ROUNDS`.
- Claude is final arbiter on every REVISE — don't cave to everything, don't ignore it.
- Do NOT write code during either act.
- Do NOT invoke `writing-plans` automatically — that's the user's decision after sign-off.
